    <release version="0.2" date="2024-01-26">
      <p>
        Binary 0.2 is the latest update to the base converter app. This update introduces Hexadecimal (or base 16) as a number base, allowing for conversions to and from hexadecimal numbers. The app also now has a green accent colour, making it feel more fun and distinctive. And invalid digits are now removed from the input box again, making the app smoother and easier to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the following smaller fixes and improvements have been made:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The removal of invalid digits in the input box is back.</li>
        <li>The output is now selectable, allowing for copy and paste instead of needing to manually type out the result.</li>
        <li>Decimal input now has data validation, and will display a toast when using an invalid digit.</li>
        <li>Wrong digit toasts will no longer duplicate, and will simply stay up when an invalid base is used.</li>
        <li>The bit counter has been slightly refreshed to be easier to understand, and is now translatable.</li>
      </ul>
    </release>
    <release version="0.1.3" date="2024-01-08">
      <description>
        <ul>
          <li>When entering an invalid digit, it no longer removes it to prevent GTK Warnings. This functionality will likely be revisited down the line</li>
          <li>Removed preferences button as it was empty and did nothing</li>
          <li>The bit counter doesn't start with "0 bits" anymore, and should have consistent functionality.</li>
          <li>Added links to the project in the about window</li>
          <li>The "Legal" section in the about window now states the GPL v3 license of the app</li>
          <li>Code cleanup</li>
        </ul>
