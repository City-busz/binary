# Binary

Binary calculator for GNOME, made in Python and with Libadwaita/GTK widgets. **Heavily WIP** with a lot of features planned and missing right now.

# Current features:
- Binary to decimal conversion

## TODO/WIP
- Bidirectional conversion
- Hexadecmial conversion
- Perform calculations as they user types 
- Nicer UI, in line with the GNOME HIG (the current one is relatively simple)
- Icon (thinking of a terminal with 1s and 0s)
- History
