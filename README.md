Binary is a simple app for GNOME to easily convert between different number bases. 
## Installing
[![https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png](https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png)](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.fizzyizzy05.binary)

Binary is officially available as a flatpak on Flathub. 

## Features
- Calculations occur as you type
- Convert between binary, decimal and hexadecimal values
- The input box removes invalid digits when they're entered
- Bit counter for binary values

## Translations
Binary uses [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/binary/binary-app/) for translations.

For automatically creating a .pot file everytime a new string is added, use update_translations.sh. This script was adapted from [Letterpress](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Letterpress/-/tree/main) by Gregor Niehl, who in turn adapted it from TheEvilSkeleton.
