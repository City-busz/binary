# Binary

![Image of Binary](img/binary-screenshot.png)

Binary calculator app, written in Python and designed with GTK and Libadwaita. ***Very*** early in development with a lot of features planned and missing right now.

## Features
### Current features:
- Binary to decimal conversion
- Performs calculations as the user types 
- Bit counter
- Bidirectional conversion
- Icon (thinking of a terminal with 1s and 0s)

### TODO/WIP
- Flatpak release
- Hexadecmial conversion
- History
  
## Testing/building
Binary was created with [GNOME Builder](https://apps.gnome.org/en-GB/Builder/). The easiest way to build this app (and the way I'm building it) is to clone this project and build it in there.
